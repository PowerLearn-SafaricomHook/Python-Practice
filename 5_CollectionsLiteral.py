# Collections literals
# Python has four types of collections literals:
# List literals
# Tuple literals
# Dict literals
# Set literals

# List literals
# List literals are written within square brackets [ ]. Lists work similarly to strings -- use the len() function and square brackets [ ] to access data, with the first element at index 0.

# List literals are written within square brackets [ ]. It is a mutable collection of items. You can add, remove, or delete elements from the list.
# example:

# empty list
my_list = []
