# Numbers in Python

# Python supports integers, floating-point numbers and complex numbers. They are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.

# Integers
# Integers can be of any length, it is only limited by the memory available.
# A floating-point number is accurate up to 15 decimal places. Integer and floating points are separated by decimal points. 1 is an integer, 1.0 is a floating-point number.
# Complex numbers are written in the form, x + yj, where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part.
# Imaginery part is written with a j suffix.

# Example:

# integer
a = 10
print(a, "is of type", type(a))

# float
a = 10.5
print(a, "is of type", type(a))

# complex number
a = 1 + 2j
print(a, "is comples number?", isinstance(1+2j, complex))
print(a, "is of type", type(a))
