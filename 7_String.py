# String in Python
# A string is a sequence of characters.
# A character is simply a symbol. For example, the English language has 26 characters.
# Computers do not deal with characters, they deal with numbers (binary). 
# Even though you may see characters on your screen, internally it is stored and manipulated as a combination of 0's and 1's.
# This conversion of character to a number is called encoding, and the reverse process is decoding. ASCII and Unicode are some of the popular encoding used.
# In Python, string is a sequence of Unicode character.
# Unicode was introduced to include every character in all languages and bring uniformity in encoding.
# You can use single or double quotes to create a string.
# Multi-line strings can be denoted using triple quotes, ''' or """.
# Like list and tuple, slicing operator [ ] can be used with string. Strings are immutable.

# Example:

# string

str = "Bradley"
print(str)

# multiline string

new_str = """This is a multiline string with more than one line code."""
print(new_str)
